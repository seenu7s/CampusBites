# CampusBites 🍽️ – Smart Canteen Ordering System

**CampusBites** is a smart, web-based food ordering system designed primarily for **college canteens**, but it can also be used in **office cafeterias, schools, or any institutional canteen**. It allows users to place orders online, view nutritional info, and collect food by scanning a QR code — eliminating the need to stand in line twice.
